Simple HTML Radio
=================

Simple HTML Radio is a jQuery plugin that helps in styling native radio buttons. It does this by hiding away the native radio button replacing it with a span element which can be styled easily. The script gracefully degrades, so if JavaScript is disabled, native radio buttons appear instead of your styled radio buttons. Its also "tabbable" and supports keyboard navigation.
